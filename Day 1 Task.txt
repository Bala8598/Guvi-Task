HTTP2  => * It will multitasking. This is more efficient and faster than HTTP1.1
          * HTTP2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.

Ques 2: Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
